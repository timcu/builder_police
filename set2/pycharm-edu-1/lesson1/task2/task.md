<h3>Lesson</h3>
<p>It is a good idea to add comments to your code. They don't affect code operation. They are there to make 
it easier for people reading the code to understand it.
Comments start with <code>#</code>. Comments can be the whole line
or at the end of a line. Indentation of comments does not affect program flow.</p>
<div style="left-margin:2em;"><code># This is a comment taking a whole line</code></div>
<div style="left-margin:2em;"><code>a=5 # This is a comment at the end of a line</code></div>

<h3>Program</h3>
<p>This program will display a countdown sequence</p>
<h3>Task</h3>
<p>The programmer has tried to add a comment to this program in the first line but now his program won't run. 
Fix the code so that the comment is still in the program and it can run.</p>
