## Lesson
It is a good idea to add comments to your code. They don't affect code operation. They are there to make
it easier for people reading the code to understand it.
Comments start with `#`. Comments can be the whole line
or at the end of a line. Indentation of comments does not affect program flow.

        # This is a comment taking a whole line
        a = 5  # This is a comment at the end of a line

## Program
This program will display a countdown sequence

## Task
The programmer has tried to add a comment to this program in the first line but now his program won't run.
Fix the code so that the comment is still in the program and it can run.

<div class='hint'>Comments in python start with a #</div>
<div class='hint'>Replace 'Comment: ' with '# '</div>
