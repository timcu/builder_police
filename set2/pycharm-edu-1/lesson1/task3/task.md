## Lesson
Use variables to store data that can be used later.

Text data is called a string and must be surrounded quotation marks.
Numbers without quotation marks are treated as a number which means you can do 
arithmetic with them. 
Numbers with quotation marks are treated as a string which means you can combine it 
with other strings to make a message.

Variables can be called any name as long as the name doesn't clash with a
 python language word (coloured blue in our example) and must start with a letter. 
 Variable names can't include spaces but can include underscores (_)
