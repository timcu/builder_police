## Lesson
If you want to use the same few lines of your program over and over again
use a loop to save typing. One type is the 'for' loop.

        for variable_name in sequence:
            # example lines of code using different value of variable_name each time
            total += variable_name
            print(variable_name, total)

Every line that gets repeated has to be indented. That is how python knows what is in the loop.
The first line which is not indented will not be executed until after the loop is complete.

## Program
Quickly count down from 10 to 1 and then display the final action

## Task
Complete the `for` statement. It needs a variable name. You will need to fix the sequence also.

<div class='hint'>
  Use the same variable in the <code>for</code> statement as will later be used in the
  <code>print</code> function
</div>
<div class='hint'>The variable used in <code>print(counter)</code> has name <code>counter</code></div>
<div class='hint'>The sequence in the <code>for</code> statement also needs fixing. Add more numbers separated by commas to this sequence.</div>
