<h3>Lesson</h3>
<p>If you want to use the same few lines of your program over and over again
use a loop to save typing. One type is the 'for' loop.</p>

<code style='margin-left:2em;'>for variable_name in sequence:</code><br />
<code style='margin-left:4em;'># example lines of code using different value of variable_name each time</code><br />
<code style='margin-left:4em;'>total += variable_name</code><br />
<code style='margin-left:4em;'>print(variable_name, total)</code><br />

<p>Every line that gets repeated has to be indented. That is how python knows what is in the loop.
The first line which is not indented will not be executed until after the loop is complete.</p>
<h3>Program</h3>
<p>Quickly count down from 10 to 1 and then display the final action</p>
<h3>Task</h3>
<p>Complete the 'for' statement. It needs a variable name. You will need to fix the sequence also.</p>
