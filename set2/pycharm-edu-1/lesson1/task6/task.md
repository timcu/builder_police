## Lesson
The `time` module has a `sleep` function to pause program for a number of seconds.
The `time` module is not included by default so has to be imported.

        from time import sleep
        sleep(2)  # sleeps for 2 seconds

## Program
Count down in seconds until blast off

## Task
Enter a statement in the loop which will pause for 1 second each time it does the loop.


<div class='hint'>All statements in loop must be indented by the same amount.</div>
<div class='hint'>Use the <code>sleep()</code> function from the <code>time</code> module</div>
<div class='hint'>Enter a parameter of 1 to specify a sleep time of 1 second</div>
