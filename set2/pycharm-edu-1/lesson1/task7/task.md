<h3>Lesson</h3>
<p>To make a game different every time you play, 
it is good to have a random number generator such as the roll of a die. The <b>random</b> module has 
a <b>randint(a,b)</b> function which will return a random integer between the values of <b>a</b> and 
<b>b</b> inclusively. You will often use this function when writing games.</p>
<h3>Program</h3>
<p>Returns a random value between 1 and 6 every time the program is run. This simulates the roll 
of a six-sided die.</p>
<h3>Task</h3>
<p>Write the program to just return a random number between 1 and 6. The program can be three lines long.</p>
<p>The first line needs to import the correct function from the random module. Remember in the previous task
the sleep function was imported from the time module using:</p>
<code>from time import sleep</code>
<p>The second line needs to call the imported function and store the result in a variable called die_roll</p>
<p>The third line needs to print the value of die_roll</p>
