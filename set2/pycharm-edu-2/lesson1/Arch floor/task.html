<h1>Arch floor</h1>
<p>The single arch is almost complete.</p>
<h2>Task</h2>
<p>Fix the floor under the arch by changing it from glass to stone</p>
<p>Place a torch on the floor at <code>(ref_z + 1)</code></p>
<img src="arch_floor.png" />
<h2>Lesson</h2>
<p>In this task you will need to enter the complete <code>build</code> command.
The <code>build</code> command is called from a <code>MinetestConnection</code> object. If your
<code>MinetestConnection</code> object is stored in a variable called <code>mc</code> then
<code>build</code> can be called from <code>mc</code>.</p>
<code>mc.build(x, y, z, item)</code>
<p>where x, y and z are the coordinates of the location to build the item. They can each be single
numbers or sequences of numbers. The item is a str or dict describing the block properties.
(More on dicts later)</p>
