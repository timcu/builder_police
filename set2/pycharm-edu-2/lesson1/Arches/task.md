# Arches
Now that you have built one arch it is easy to build several arches.

## Task
Change the value of `range_x_arch` to be a sequence of four x values where
each arch is separated by three blocks. ie the values are counting up in fours.

<div class='hint'>Change the value in one variable to build four arches instead of one arch</div>
<div class='hint'><code>range_x_arch</code> needs to be the list of numbers or formula to return a sequence of four x values, every 4 blocks starting at path_x_min</div>
<div class='hint'><code>[105, 109, 113, 117]</code><br>
<br>
is one answer</div>
<div class='hint'><code>range(path_x_min, path_xmin + path_length, 4)</code><br>
<br>
is another answer</div>
