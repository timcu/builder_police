<h1>Castle base</h1>
<p>We are going to start by building the base of the castle.
The base will be a room with four walls and no roof. We can 
build this by building a cuboid of stone and then inside that
a cuboid of air. We will replace two blocks in the front wall
to make a doorway.</p>
<p>The base section of the castle will be 5 blocks high. 
The length of the castle will be 9 blocks. The width of the 
castle will be 5 blocks.</p>
<h2>Task</h2>
<p>Create a 9 x 5 x 5 open top stone box starting at x = 121, y = 9. Add a 2 x 1 doorway.</p>
