<h1>Castle roof</h1>
<p>The castle roof sits on top of the castle base. It is a similar shape to the castle base,
an open box without a top, but it extends on block on every side in the x and z directions
and is only three blocks high.</p>
<h2>Task</h2>
<p>Add a 11 x 7 x 3 open top stone box on top of the castle base to be the roof. </p>
<p>Add a ladder so that players can climb up the ladder to the roof. Ladder
needs a direction so that its orientation is known and in which part of the cube of space the
ladder should be placed. See the hints for more details.</p>
