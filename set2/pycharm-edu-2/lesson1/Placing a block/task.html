<h1>Task 1a - Placing a block</h1>

<h2>Lesson</h2>
<p>This first task teaches you how to place a block using the <code>build</code> command from MinetestConnection.
The following line places a stone block at x=100, y=14, z=0. The <code>build</code> command saves all the blocks in a <code>building</code> and then the <code>building</code> is sent to Minetest using the <code>send_building</code> command.</p>
<code>mc.build(100, 14, 0, "default:stone")</code><br>
<code>mc.send_building()</code>
<p>The <code>build</code> command has 4 parameters.
They are x, y, z, and node_type. The first 3 parameters are the coordinates where the node will be placed.
The last parameter is the name of the material to place. Examples are "default:wood", "default:dirt", "wool:blue", "default:glass", "carts:rail".
The material names are the name of the mod they come from, a colon (:), and then the material name within that mod.</p>
<p>Hints are available by clicking the light bulb above.</p>
<p>Click the green triangle "play" button to run your program or use keyboard ctrl-shift-F10.</p>
<p>Click the "Check task" button (first button in toolbar above) to
check you have completed the task correctly and move on to next task.</p>
<p>When you have completed this task (Congratulations!) click the blue right arrow to
move to the next task.</p>
