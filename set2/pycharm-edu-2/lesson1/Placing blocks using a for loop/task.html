<h1>Task 3a - Placing blocks using a <code>for</code> loop</h1>
<p>The previous example was a lot of typing to place 9 blocks. Is there an easier way?</p>
<h2>Task</h2>
<p>Place 9 obsidian glass blocks in a square at x = 99. Centre of square is 
y = 14 and z = your player z value from Minetest. This will partially complete Minetest 
Task 3 which you can read on your sign in Minetest.</p>

<h2>Lesson</h2>
<p>In the previous example we needed
    nine <code>build</code> commands to place nine blocks.
Doing repetitive tasks is what computers are good at. If we are repeating the same task several times we tell the
computer to run in a loop until the task has been done the correct number of times. Unfortunately the task was
slightly different each time. Let's look at six of the commands in a slightly different order.</p>
<code>mc.build(99, 13, ref_z - 1, glass)</code><br>
<code>mc.build(99, 13, ref_z + 1, glass)</code><br>
<code>mc.build(99, 14, ref_z - 1, glass)</code><br>
<code>mc.build(99, 14, ref_z + 1, glass)</code><br>
<code>mc.build(99, 15, ref_z - 1, glass)</code><br>
<code>mc.build(99, 15, ref_z + 1, glass)</code><br>
<p>There are three pairs of commands which are almost the same except the y coordinate is different each time. This is where a <code>for</code>
can be used. We use a variable, in this case <code>y</code> which has a different value each time through the
loop. We start the loop with </p>
<code>for</code> <em>variable name</em> <code>in</code> <em>sequence</em><code>:</code>
<p>The sequence is the list of values to use for that variable
each time through the loop. All the lines to be repeated in the loop are indented. The loop ends when the indentation
finishes. For example:</p>
<code>for y in (13, 14, 15):</code></br>
<code class="t1">print(y)</code><br>
<code>print("finished")</code><br>
<p>will have the following output</p>
<pre>13
14
15
finished</pre>
<p>The six lines above can be replaced with three lines.</p>
<code>for y in (13, 14, 15):</code><br>
<code class="t1">mc.build(99, y, ref_z - 1, glass)</code><br>
<code class="t1">mc.build(99, y, ref_z + 1, glass)</code><br>
