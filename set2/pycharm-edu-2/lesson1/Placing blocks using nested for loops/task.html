<h1>Task 3b - Placing blocks using nested <code>for</code> loops</h1>
<p>Nested loops are a loop within a loop.</p>
<h2>Task</h2>
<p>Place a 3x3 square of obsidian glass at x = 101. 
Centre of square at y = 14 and z = player z. Remember you can used formulae (eg ref_z - 1, ref_z, ref_z + 1) or 
numbers (eg 19, 20, 21) in the sequence in the <code>for</code> statement.</p>
<p>This will also add to Minetest Task 3. However, because we have used obsidian glass rather
then normal glass, Minetest won't accept your task attempt as complete yet. </p>

<h2>Lesson</h2>
<p>If you want your program to loop with two values changing you can nest the <code>for</code>
loops. We already have a loop for y. Within the loop we can have a loop for z. Any code
in the z loop needs to be indented twice. Code in the y loop is only indented once. </p>
<code>for y in (13, 14, 15):</code><br>
<code class="t1">for z in (19, 20, 21):</code><br>
<code class="t2">print("y", y, "z", z)</code>
<p>In your task.py python program on the left, there is
a print statement in the z loop. When you run the code using ctrl-shift-F10 you can see the
values of y and z each time through the loop.</p>
<p>In the sequence of numbers you can use numbers, variables or even formulae using the variables.
Here is an example using formulae.</p>
<code>for z in (ref_z - 1, ref_z, ref_z + 1):</code>
