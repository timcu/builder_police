# Task 3c - Placing multiple blocks in one build
There is an even easier way than using `for` loops.

## Task
Place a 3x3x3 cube of glass blocks centred at (100, 14, ref_z). Use wool for the centre block

Once you have completed this task, Minetest task 3 will be complete.

## Lesson
Placing multiple blocks of the same kind at the same time is such a common
requirement, the `build` command has been designed to accept number sequences
for the x, y and z coordinates. Previously we have used a `for` loop.

        for y in [13, 14, 15]:
            mc.build(99, y, 0, glass)

This can now be rewritten in one line

        mc.build(99, [13, 14, 15], 0, glass)

It will place three glass blocks at (99, 13, 0), (99, 14, 0) and (99, 15, 0).
Number sequences are not restricted to one parameter. If there is more than one sequence
then it works like nested loops.

        mc.build([99, 100], [13, 14, 15], 0, glass)

places six glass blocks at (99, 13, 0), (99, 14, 0), (99, 15, 0), (100, 13, 0), (100, 14, 0), (100, 15, 0).

Each sequence of numbers can be stored in a variable rather than typed directly
in the `build` command. The numbers in the sequences don't even need to be consecutive.

        seq_x = [99, 101]
        seq_y = [13, 15]
        mc.build(seq_x, seq_y, 0, glass)

places four glass blocks at (99, 13, 0), (99, 15, 0), (101, 13, 0), (101, 15, 0).

## Overwriting positions
If you do more than one `build` command for the same position, the second command will overwrite
the first command.
