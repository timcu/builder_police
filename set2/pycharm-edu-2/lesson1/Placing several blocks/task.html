<h1>Task 2 - Placing several blocks</h1>
<p>This is the easy course. Whenever the task asks for variable names
or a formula, then it is also correct to just type in a number or list of numbers.</p>
<h2>Task</h2>
<p>Find your sign in Minetest to find your second task. Then complete the program on the left
to satisfy the task.</p>

<h2>Lesson</h2>
<p>A program starts at the top and runs each line in sequence. If you want to place
several blocks, create a new <code>build</code> command for each block. When you have finished
all the <code>build</code> commands, run the <code>send_building</code> command to
send all the blocks you have built to Minetest. If two of the <code>build</code> commands
have the same x, y, z coordinates, the second will replace the previous block before it even gets sent
to Minetest.</p>
