<h1>Minetest setup</h1>
<ol>
    <li>The first step is to play Minetest :). Play online and connect to a Pythonator server.
        You can even connect to the free server at <code>demo.pythonator.com</code> using port
        <code>30000</code>.
        Use a name and password of your choosing, and as long as no-one else has chosen that
        name you will be able to login. </li>
    <li>Please don't use spaces in your name or password. If you need to change your password in
    Minetest press the [esc] key and click the [Change password] button.</li>
    <li>Don't use a password you want keep secret because there is very low security on this
    server and other people can find out your password. I don't mind if your password
    is just "<em>password</em>" but be prepared for others to login as you if you
    do that.</li>
<li>Check if you have the <code>irc_builder</code> privilege by typing
    <code>/privs</code> in Minetest chat. It should be automatic but if not ask
    the Minetest op for that privilege.</li>
<li>Fill in your connection details to Minetest in the program on the left.
    <ul>
<li>Enter your name as mtuser (mtuser="myname")</li>
<li>Enter your password as mtuserpass (mtuserpass="mysecret")</li>
        <li>Find your z value from the sign in Minetest with your name in it.
        Every player gets a unique value.</li>
<li>Server details default for the <code>demo.pythonator.com</code> server. For other servers ask your Minetest op.</li>
    </ul>
</li>
<li>Click the [Check] button below or [Check task] above. </li>
    <li>When you have completed this setup correctly you will see "Congratulations!".
        Click the right arrow to move to the first task.</li>
</ol>
<p>Here is an example of how to fill in the details for LAN servers at CoderDojo.</p>
<code></code><br />
<code>mtuser = "tim"      # your minetest username</code><br />
<code>mtuserpass = "not_so_secret"  # your minetest password. This file is not encrypted so don't use anything you want kept secret</code><br />
<code>player_z = 10       # your z value from sign in minetest with your username on it</code><br />
<code></code><br />
<code># The following must match your settings in minetest server > Settings > Advanced Settings > Mods > irc > Basic ></code><br />
<code>ircserver = "192.168.17.100"   # same as IRC server</code><br />
<code>mtbotnick = "mtserver"   # same as Bot nickname</code><br />
<code>channel = "#coderdojo"     # same as Channel to join</code><br />
