<h1>Task 5 - Tunnel floor</h1>
<p>Look in your tunnel in the Minetest world to see Task 5. </p>
<h2>Task</h2>
<p>Replace the floor of the tunnel with stone and place a torch every four blocks.
Think carefully when you are filling in your task.py program whether you need 
a single number or sequence of numbers for each answer.

<h2>Lesson</h2>
<p>Remember when using the <code>range()</code> function you can specify the step as
well as the start and stop values.</p>
<code>range(<em>start, stop, step</em>)</code>
<p>The step value defaults to <code>1</code> if you don't include it which is fine if you are
counting up in ones. However, if you are counting up in fours, include a step value of 4.
If you are counting down, make sure your step is negative.</p>
<code>range(93, 70, -4) # is equivalent to (93, 89, 85, 81, 77, 73)</code>
