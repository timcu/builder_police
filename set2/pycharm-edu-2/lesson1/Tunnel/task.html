<h1>Task 4 - Tunnel</h1>
<p>Visit the Minetest world to find your next task. You will have to climb down a ladder to find your
    next task on two signs.
    In Minetest you descend ladders using the &lt;shift&gt; key. To ascend, use &lt;space&gt;.</p>
<h2>Task</h2>
<p>Build a tunnel by building a cuboid of glass and then building a cuboid of air in the centre.</p>

<h2>Lesson</h2>
<p>Number sequences are used frequently so Python has a <code>range()</code> function which can
produce them easily. The <code>range()</code> function has up to three arguments, the start value, the stop value and the
increment value. A trap with the <code>range()</code> function is it counts up to but not including
the stop value. This is actually useful because it means when increment is 1 (the default)
the stop value minus the start value is the length of the sequence, and in our case that means the
number of blocks placed.</p>
<p>The three forms of the <code>range()</code> function are:</p>
<code>range(stop)</code><br>
<code>range(start, stop)</code><br>
<code>range(start, stop, increment)</code><br>
<p>Examples</p>
<code>range(3) # equivalent to (0, 1, 2)</code><br>
<code>range(2, 5) # equivalent to (2, 3, 4)</code><br>
<code>range(4, 0) # equivalent to () because range() won't count backwards by default</code><br>
<code>range(4, 0, -1) # equivalent to (4, 3, 2, 1)</code><br>
<code>range(70, 93, 4) # equivalent to (70, 74, 78, 82, 86, 90)</code><br>
<p>Your task in Minetest will have a height, a width,
x1, x2, y and z values. These numbers will need to be assigned correctly to the variables
ref_z, x_max, x_min, floor_y, tunnel_height, tunnel_width.</p>
<p>In this task store sequences of numbers in range_y_ext and range_z_ext. Start with entering as
lists of numbers. If you feel confident, convert that list to use the <code>range()</code>
function. Once that works, try using variable names and formulae. They will be similar to
those used in range_x, range_y_int and range_z_int.</p>
