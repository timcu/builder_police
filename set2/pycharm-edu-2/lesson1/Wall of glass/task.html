<h1>Wall of glass</h1>
<p>There are several steps to this program which is
going to build some arches over the path heading
from your signpost in the positive x direction. Each arch will
have the same profile as a cross section of the tunnel
you have just built.</p><h2>Task</h2>
<p>Build a solid wall of glass 7 high x 5 wide at x = 105. Glass block in the centre at the 
bottom of the wall should be at y = 9, z = <em>your player z</em>.</p>
<p>This is not one of the tasks assigned by Minetest. It is a repetition of Minetest tasks
4 and 5 with some variations.</p>

<h2>Lesson</h2>
<p>The first step is to build a glass wall. This is similar to the first step in
building the tunnel which was to build a solid glass cuboid.</p>
<ul>
<li>The minimum x value on the path is 105 so store that in variable <code>path_x_min</code></li>
<li>The stone on the path is at level 9 so store that in variable <code>floor_y</code></li>
<li>The arch will have same dimensions as tunnel, 7 high and 5 wide, so store in <code>arch_height</code> and <code>arch_width</code></li>
</ul>
<p>We need to calculate the z position of the sides of the arch. We know the z position
of the centre of the arch and we know the width of the arch. Hence the formula is</p>
<code>wall_z = ref_z - arch_width // 2</code>
<p>We are going to store the x values of the arches in variable <code>range_x_arch</code>. For testing we
will start with one x value. Let us use the start of the path which is <code>path_x_min</code>.</p>
<code>range_x_arch = path_x_min</code>
<p>Store the external dimensions of the arch in <code>range_y_ext</code> and <code>range_z_ext</code>.</p>
<code>range_y_ext = range(floor_y, floor_y + arch_height)</code><br>
<code>range_z_ext = range(wall_z, wall_z + arch_width)</code>
<p>Remember that the <code>range()</code> function returns a sequence of numbers. For
our purposes the formula above for <code>range_y_ext</code> is equivalent to typing:</p>
<code>range_y_ext = [9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]</code>
