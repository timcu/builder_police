# Task 3 - Placing several blocks
This is the easy course. Whenever the task asks for variable names
or a formula, then it is also correct to just type in a number or list of numbers. The only
time this won't work is for variables in loops which we will look at in the task 4.

## Task
Find your sign in Minetest to find your third task. Then complete the program on the left
to satisfy the task. The picture shows you what you are trying to build.

## Lesson
A program starts at the top and runs each line in order. If you want to place
several blocks, create a new `build` command for each block. When you have finished
all the `build` commands, run the `send_building` command to
send all the blocks you have built to Minetest. If two of the `build` commands
have the same x, y, z coordinates, the second will replace the previous block before it even gets sent
to Minetest.

<div class='hint'>ref_z should be set to the value of z on your sign in Minetest.</div>
<div class='hint'>The second <code>build</code> command needs an x value. It is the same x value used in every other <code>build</code> command on this task</div>
<div class='hint'>The fifth <code>build</code> command needs a z value for the centre wool block. You can enter a number or the name of the variable containing that number.</div>
<div class='hint'>The ninth <code>build</code> command needs the z value for the top right glass block.
Enter the number or a formula which equals that z value.</div>
