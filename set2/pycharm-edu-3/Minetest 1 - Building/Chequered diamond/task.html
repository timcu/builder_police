<h1>Task 7 - Chequered diamond</h1>
<p>Construct a vertical diamond shape of alternating wool colours in the sky with height of 21 blocks</p>
<p>Most of the code is similar to the chequered square. This challenge is to come up with formulae for xlo and yhi,
the low and high values of x where you want to place blocks. And remember, the hints can be your friend.</p>
