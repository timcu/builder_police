<h1>Task 9 - Stairs and rail</h1>
<p>Put rail and powered rail along centre of your tunnel.
Where the tunnel is sloping, place stairs down the left side. </p>
<p>Where the tunnel is flat we don't need so much power
rail. Use two pieces of rail followed by two pieces of
power rail, and keep alternating two at a time.</p>
<p>Stairs need a direction as well as a type. The type is "stairs:stair_stonebrick".
The direction is stored in a second parameter called param2. To use 
a second parameter we use JSON (JavaScript Object Notation). The JSON string for 
stonebrick stairs sloping upward to positive z is<p> 
<code>'{"name":"stairs:stair_stonebrick","param2":"0"}'</code>
<p>The different values of param2 are</p>
<div style="font-family:monospace">0: z direction upward</div>
<div style="font-family:monospace">1: x direction upward</div>
<div style="font-family:monospace">2: z direction downward</div>
<div style="font-family:monospace">3: x direction downward</div>
<p>The first image shows the stairs and rail on the
sloping section of the tunnel.</p>
