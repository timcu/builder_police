<h2>Dictionaries</h2>
<p>A dictionary is a mutable group of data elements that are accessed by keys rather than their numeric
position in the dictionary. The data type is named after the book by the same name because in the book 
the word is the key and the meaning is the data element. You can only have one data element per key
although that data element could be a complex data type such as a tuple, list or another dictionary.
To create a dictionary, the keys and values are separated by colons (:) and the "key:value" pairs are 
separated by commas. Try the following examples in the console</p>
<div><code>d1={'score':25, 'another':'mine', 43:'numeric key', 'secret':"don't look"} # creates dict</code></div>
<div><code>d1['secret'] # should display "don't look"</code></div>
<div><code>d1['another']='dog' # assigns new value for existing key</code></div>
<div><code>del(d1[43]) # removes data element with key 43 </code></div>
<div><code>del(d1['secret']) # removes data element with key 43 </code></div>
<div><code>d1['height']=180 # adds a new data element and key</code></div>
<div><code>d1 # {'score': 25, 'another': 'dog', 'height': 180}</code></div>
<div><code>for k,v in d1.items(): print("key=",k," value=",v) # loops through key:value pairs</code></div>
<div><code>d1={} # creates an empty dictionary</code></div>
<div><code>di=dict() # alternative method of creating empty dictionary</code></div>
