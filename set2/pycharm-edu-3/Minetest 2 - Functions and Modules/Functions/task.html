<h1>Functions</h1>
<p>When you need the same code to be used in several places, it
is easier to put that code in a function and then call that function
when it needs to run that code. Functions are defined used the 
<code>def</code> command, followed by the function name and then,
in parentheses (), the arguments of the function.</p>
<p>In the last task we discovered we needed to convert all 
coordinates to integers when adding to nodes_dict. Otherwise new nodes
for the same position would not overwrite the old nodes. That will soon
get tedious so we will create a function <code>build()</code> which
does it for us.</p>
<p><code>build()</code> will return a dictionary with the new
node in it. We will merge that with our existing dictionary 
using the dict <code>update()</code> function which overwrites
existing data when key is the same.</p>
