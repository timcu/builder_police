<h1>Railway station</h1>
<p>We have all the helper functions to build 
complex structures quickly saved in the minetest_helper.py
module. Now we can start building them. The first 
structure will be a railway station.</p>
<p>The design of the station will be implemented in a
function. The user of this function will be able
to change the appearance by setting arguments to the function
such as </p>
<ul>
<li>location</li>
<li>length of platform</li>
<li>size of waiting room</li>
<li>building materials</li>
<li>number of storeys (levels)</li>
</ul>
<p>We make life a bit easier for the user by providing defaults 
for arguments which are not set explicitly. This means the user
only has to provide specifications which are different to the 
defaults. The only data which needs to be provided is the 
location of the station. The user needs to pass in a dictionary
for the function to store the built node data before it is
sent to minetest</p>
<p>Try to follow through the function to see how the different
parts of the station are built. There are comments before each
section because it is not obvious from reading set_nodes commands
what is being achieved at each step.</p> 
<p>Once we are finished developing this function we will add
it to minetest_helper.py module so it can be called from other 
functions.</p>
